## Installation Instructions

### Installing OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib with pip

1. **OpenCV**: Install OpenCV using pip, preferably within a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python

   pip install numpy

   pip install matplotlib

 Installation within a Virtual Environment. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

Create a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv

# Using venv (Python 3.x)
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux or MacOS)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

Verify Installation
